      I came up with an app,where it easily shows you all the information about a stock.The app will tells you the current situation of the stock and the company.It will find information from other websites and combine them into one and clearly tell you if you should buy it or sell it.It will also tell you if the stock is for long or short term investors which allows  you to know how long you would have to hold the stock for until you actually start making profits.This would be critical if you only have a few dollars to invest in stocks.This app will run of the software call python which will allow me to make a bot that can analyze different website and stitch all the information into one to tell investors the best option to do with a stock.It could either to sell or buy the stock.
